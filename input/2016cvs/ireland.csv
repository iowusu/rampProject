Aiden McGeady,Ireland,"Glasgow-born winger, who worked under Martin O'Neill at Celtic, he fell from favour at Everton this season and moved on loan to Sheffield Wednesday in February, in order to gain regular minutes.

Ciaran Clark,Ireland,"Represented England at under-17 to under-20 level, the Essex-born central defender declared for Ireland in 2010 and was immediately called up by Giovanni Trapattoni.

Cyrus Christie,Ireland,"A right-back who loves to get forward, his performance in the 1-0 win over Germany in qualification was the stuff that cult heroes are made of. Scored in the away win over Gibraltar. The back-up to Seamus Coleman.",yes,,Defender,,4,1,Derby County,Championship (England),30/09/1992,,,,
Darren Randolph,Ireland,"He was brought on – surprisingly, ahead of David Forde – when Shay Given was injured in the 1-0 home win over Germany during qualification and he has not since looked back.

Daryl Murphy,Ireland,"Can play on the left, and has done so many times, but he is much happier as a No 9. His career has been stop-start, with a lot of moves but he has settled at Ipswich Town.

The son of the hurling manager, John Meyler, he played hurling and Gaelic football as a boy.",yes,,Midfielder,,14,0,Hull City,Championship (England),29/05/1989,,,,
Glenn Whelan,Ireland,"Tough tackler, who screens the back four and organises the team, the Stoke City midfielder has been a regular since Giovanni Trapattoni called him into his first squad in May 2008. Worked his way back up the divisions after leaving his first club, Manchester City.",yes,Unsung hero,Midfielder,,71,2,Stoke City,Premier League (England),13/01/1984,,,,
James McCarthy,Ireland,"Born and raised in Glasgow, his decision to declare for Ireland – the country of his grandfather's birth – as a 16-year-old created a storm in Scotland. Made his professional debut at 15 for Hamilton Academical, the box-to-box midfielder is regarded as one of Ireland's biggest talents.",yes,,Midfielder,,35,0,Everton,Premier League (England),12/11/1990,,,,
James McClean,Ireland,"The Derry-born winger represented Northern Ireland at under-21 level before he declared for the Republic.

Jeff Hendrick,Ireland,"Emerged at St Kevin's Boys in Dublin, where he played alongside Robbie Brady from the age of six, the energetic midfielder crossed to Derby County as a trainee and he has made his mark there.

Jon Walters,Ireland,"One of the heroes of the qualification with five goals, including both in the 2-0 play-off, second-leg home win over Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was decisive. Direct, physical and relentless, his style ruffles defenders' feathers.",yes,Hard man,Forward,,39,10,Stoke City,Premier League (England),20/09/1983,,,,
Richard Keogh,Ireland,"Much-travelled centre-half, he owes his senior international career to the durability, consistency and leadership he has shown as captain of Derby County. Martin O'Neill has placed his faith in him and started him alongside Ciaran Clark in both legs of the qualification play-off victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina.",yes,,Defender,,11,1,Derby County,Championship (England),11/08/1986,,,,
Robbie Brady,Ireland,"Nominally a winger, who can also play as a No10, he has been used to good effect at left-back by Martin O'Neill. Admitted that he lacked focus when he was a trainee at Manchester United, Brady has gone on to show his quality at Hull City and now Norwich City.",yes,,Defender,,24,4,Norwich City,Premier League (England),14/01/1992,,,,
Robbie Keane,Ireland,"The captain, record caps holder and record goalscorer, he might no longer be an automatic starter but his value to the squad remains high.

Shane Long,Ireland,"His winning goal in the 1-0 home win over Germany during qualification will live long in the memory and was, in many respects, the touchstone of the Martin O'Neill era. The one-time hurler for Tipperary brings aerial power and the pace to stretch defences.",yes,Main goalscorer,Forward,,62,16,Southampton,Premier League (England),22/01/1987,,,,
Shay Given,Ireland,"First capped in 1996, the veteran announced his retirement after Euro 2012 only to make a surprise return in September 2014.

Has endured a frustrating season at Stoke City.",yes,,Goalkeeper,,133,0,Stoke City,Premier League (England),20/04/1976,,,,
Stephen Quinn,Ireland,"It was a measure of the faith that Martin O'Neill has in him that the Reading midfielder started in the opening two away qualifiers against Georgia and Germany. Industrious and aggressive, with a cultured left foot.",yes,,Midfielder,,14,0,Reading,Championship (England),01/04/1986,,,,
Stephen Ward,Ireland,"A fixture at left-back during the Euro 2012 campaign, who started at the finals, he dropped out of contention before being recalled by Martin O'Neill. Can play in more advanced positions. Was a striker at Bohemians early on in his career.",yes,,Defender,,32,2,Burnley,Championship (England),20/08/1985,,,,
Wes Hoolahan,Ireland,"The Irish Messi, or Wessi, is the team's string-puller, who is normally given a roving role.

Martin O'Neill believes that he has plenty of international football ahead of him.",yes,,Midfielder,,30,2,Norwich City,Premier League (England),20/05/1982,,,,
Keiren Westwood,Ireland,"Manchester-born, he started his career at City but never played for them. Has been with Sheffield Wednesday since 2014 after three years at Sunderland.

",no,,Goalkeeper,,18,0,Sheffield Wednesday,Championship (England),23/10/1984,,,,
Shane Duffy,Ireland,"The centre-half played for Northern Ireland at youth level and was an unused substitute in their senior team as a 17-year-old before he switched his allegiance. Had life-saving surgery on a liver problem in 2010, after a freak practice match injury. Has developed at Blackburn Rovers, after struggling for opportunity at Everton.",no,,Defender,,2,0,Blackburn Rovers,Championship (England),01/01/1992,,,,
