Fraser Forster,England,"A man-mountain who has been elevated to second-choice in the absence of the injured Jack Butland. Excellent for Southampton now he has recovered from a lengthy knee injury, he was unused at the 2014 World Cup but has proved reliable when called upon.",yes,,Goalkeeper,,6,0,Southampton,Premier League (England),17/03/1988,,,,
Joe Hart,England,"Eight years after his debut, the Manchester City goalkeeper is clearly established as England's first-choice. Did not feature at the 2010 World Cup, but started the next two major tournaments and nine of England's Euro 2016 qualifiers. Strong, authoritative and a reassuring presence.",yes,No1 goalkeeper,Goalkeeper,,58,0,Manchester City,Premier League (England),19/04/1987,,,,
Tom Heaton,England,The much travelled goalkeeper made his international debut against Australia just before the Euros and has been a regular in Hodgson's squad as third-choice over the last 18 months despite spending the season in the Championship with Burnley. ,yes,,Goalkeeper,,1,0,Burnley,Championship (England),15/04/1986,,,,
Ryan Bertrand,England,"Made his senior debut in a friendly win against Italy in Switzerland immediately after Euro 2012, but has flourished more regularly recently after excelling for Southampton. His senior career to date has been limited to only two competitive matches, but he is well placed to compete for a starting place at left-back in France.",yes,,Defender,,8,0,Southampton,Premier League (England),05/08/1989,,,,
Gary Cahill,England,"Hodgson's vice-captain and a regular under this manager, he will hope to make up for missing out on Euro 2012 after breaking his jaw in a friendly against Belgium just before the tournament. The Chelsea centre-half has captained the team on occasion – not least in the victory in Germany in March – and is a rugged performer, despite struggling at times to hold down his position at club level this season.",yes,,Defender,,42,3,Chelsea,Premier League (England),19/12/1985,,,,
Nathaniel Clyne,England,"Quick and aggressive down the flank, the Liverpool player appears to have convinced Hodgson he should be considered England's first-choice right-back. He can operate at left-back if required, which adds to his attraction, but his first major tournament will be a proper test of his development after a testing first year as a Liverpool player.",yes,,Defender,,12,0,Liverpool,Premier League (England),05/04/1991,,,,
Danny Rose,England,"The left-back had made regular appearances in England squads but, after a fine season at Tottenham Hotspur, only debuted in Berlin in March with an impressive display against the reigning world champions. Diminutive, quick and attack-minded, his delivery is a considerable asset.",yes,,Defender,,3,0,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League (England),02/07/1990,,,,
Chris Smalling,England,"A Hodgson favourite from his days as Fulham manager, the former Maidstone defender has become a mainstay of the back-line in recent times, bringing encouraging club form on to the international stage. Played against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte but will go into these finals as England's first-choice centre-back.",yes,,Defender,,24,0,Manchester United,Premier League (England),22/11/1989,,,,
John Stones,England,"Such a classy performer on the ball, though prone to over-elaboration in unwise positions, as demonstrated against the Dutch in March. Hodgson has long earmarked him as the future of the national team at centre-half, though Stones' appearances have more usually been at right-back. The manager even discussed using him in defensive midfield last autumn.",yes,,Defender,,10,0,Everton,Premier League (England),28/05/1994,,,,
Kyle Walker,England,"Named in Uefa's team of the tournament at the 2011 European U21s Championship, he made his senior debut in a friendly victory over Spain later that year. A toe injury kept him out of Euro 2012 but he has been regularly involved in the period since and has enjoyed a fine campaign at Tottenham. ",yes,,Defender,,15,0,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League (England),28/05/1990,,,,
Dele Alli,England,"Was promoted into the England senior set-up as a teenager last autumn and has not looked back, quickly establishing himself as a key, energetic member of Hodgson's team. He can operate as a No10 or in one of the wide positions of a midfield three, and provides the side's forward thrust and energy. Scored his first senior goal against France and was outstanding in the win in Germany.",yes,Young talent,Midfielder,,7,1,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League (England),11/04/1996,,,,
Ross Barkley,England,"Criticised at times by Hodgson for surrendering possession in dangerous areas, Barkley remains one of English football great hopes. The 22-year-old featured at the World Cup two years ago and was the team's attacking inspiration through the autumn, operating more successfully as a central playmaker. Strong, clever in his delivery and a goal threat.",yes,,Midfielder,,22,2,Everton,Premier League (England),05/12/1993,,,,
Eric Dier,England,"One of the many revelations of Tottenham's season, the player schooled in Portugal at Sporting has switched from centre-half cum right-back to defensive midfield and excelled. He was excellent against the French at Wembley in November, and scored the stoppage time winner to beat Germany in Berlin in March. Solid, dependable and clever with his positioning.",yes,,Midfielder,,6,1,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League (England),15/01/1994,,,,
Jordan Henderson,England,"Liverpool's captain has not enjoyed his best season at club level, but he remains a mainstay of Hodgson's midfield having made his international bow six years ago. Replaced the injured Frank Lampard at Euro 2012, and started in Manaus and Sao Paulo two years later, England have tapped into his energy and delivery from set-plays.",yes,,Midfielder,,24,0,Liverpool,Premier League (England),17/06/1990,,,,
Adam Lallana,England,"A clever player capable of operating wide in a front three, or tighter in a midfield diamond. He must start contributing regular goals for his country to justify regular inclusion, but Hodgson has leant upon him as a reliable, selfless and industrious creator.",yes,,Midfielder,,22,0,Liverpool,Premier League (England),10/05/1988,,,,
James Milner,England,"England's Mr Reliable over seven years in the national set-up. Only Rooney boasts more caps in the current squad, with Milner having featured in three major tournaments to date. The Liverpool player can operate across midfield, even as a deep-lying anchor if required, and at right-back, but has suggested Euro 2016 might be his last involvement with the national side.",yes,Unsung hero,Midfielder,,59,1,Liverpool,Premier League (England),04/01/1986,,,,
Jack Wilshere,England,"First capped as an 18-year-old by Fabio Capello, Hodgson has utilised Wilshere at the base of his midfield as a calm distributor of possession rather than a fierce tackler. He has thrived in the position and, when required, burst forward to assist the attack, scoring a brace against Slovenia last summer and confirm his potential. Injuries have limited his involvement ever since.",yes,,Midfielder,,30,2,Arsenal,Premier League (England),01/01/1992,,,,
Harry Kane,England,"Scored on debut 80 seconds after his introduction as a substitute against Lithuania in a European qualifier in March 2015, and now England's most obvious No9 selection after prolific form with Tottenham Hotspur. A regular in the national set-up's junior ranks, but would have qualified for Republic of Ireland through his father.",yes,,Forward,,11,5,Tottenham,Premier League (England),28/07/1993,,,,
Wayne Rooney,England,"England's captain and record goalscorer, with 51 to his name. Burst on to the international scene at Euro 2004, but has endured frustration at virtually every major tournament he has graced since, from dismal form, a lack of fitness or untimely red cards. This may be his last opportunity to excel on the grandest stage.",yes,Legend,Forward,,110,52,Manchester United,Premier League (England),24/10/1985,,1,3,
Raheem Sterling,England,"Only the fifth Englishman to be capped prior to his 18th birthday, Sterling was called up by Hodgson after Euro 2012 and his performance against Italy in Manaus was arguably the highlight of the team's World Cup campaign in 2014. Has been used wide right but also at the tip of a midfield diamond, where he revelled in the Amazon.",yes,,Forward (winger),,22,2,Manchester City,Premier League (England),08/12/1994,,,,
Daniel Sturridge,England,"Represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics and, having graduated through the junior levels, made his senior debut under Fabio Capello. One of the brighter attacking performers at the 2014 World Cup and, when fit, a key member of Hodgson's front-line options. ",yes,,Forward,,17,5,Liverpool,Premier League (England),01/09/1989,,,,
Jamie Vardy,England,"Hodgson was impressed with Vardy's raw ability, all energy and industry, through Leicester's relegation fight in 2014/15 and offered the striker a debut in Dublin last summer. Scored his first international goals against Germany and the Netherlands in March, and can operate both wide or through the middle.",yes,Maverick,Forward,,6,3,Leicester City,Premier League (England),11/01/1987,,,,
Marcus Rashford,England,"The teenager has demanded inclusion in the squad with his performances since breaking into United’s first team amid an injury crisis in late February. He scored twice that evening, against Midtjylland, and has seven goals in 16 club games. Become England's youngest debutant when he scored in the pre-Euro 2016 friendly against Australia. It did not take him long to make his mark either, just three minutes.",yes,,Forward,,1,1,Manchester United,Premier League (England),31/10/1997,,,,
