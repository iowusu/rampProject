Michael McGovern,North-Ireland,"Replaced Roy Carroll, his fellow Enniskillen-born keeper, during the Euro qualifying campaign but his hold on the number one spot faltered after an almost-costly slip against Hungary. Was otherwise assured for O’Neill’s team as he made up for lost time having endured a five-year wait from 2010 to win his second cap.",yes,No1 goalkeeper,Goalkeeper,,10,0,Hamilton Academicals,Premiership (Scotland),12/07/1984,,,,
Roy Carroll,North-Ireland,"A first major tournament beckons for the veteran goalkeeper 19 year after his international debut. Carroll was overlooked by his country for six years, reclaimed and then lost his place in Michael O’Neill’s team through illness, but remains in contention for a start in France. Impressed in the warm-up win over Slovenia.",yes,,Goalkeeper,,44,0,Notts County,League Two (England),30/09/1977,,,,
Alan Mannus,North-Ireland,"Born in Toronto, although the Canadian FA never got in touch, the back-up keeper has been a regular in the Northern Ireland set-up for 12 years.",yes,,Goalkeeper,,8,0,St Johnstone,Premiership (Scotland),19/05/1982,,,,
Gareth McAuley,North-Ireland,"Overlooked at every level of international football until he was 25, the epitome of the late developer has become an integral part of Northern Ireland’s disciplined defence. Hugely popular with supporters and carries an important threat at set-pieces for O’Neill’s team.",yes,Hard man,Defender,,60,7,West Bromwich Albion,Premier League (England),05/12/1979,,,,
Jonny Evans,North-Ireland,Lawrie Sanchez handed the defender an international debut before he played for Manchester United in 2006 and the then 18-year-old flourished in a memorable European Championship qualifying win over Spain. Restricted by injury to only four qualifiers en route to France but his experience and understanding alongside Gareth McAuley is crucial to O’Neill.,yes,Defensive mainstay,Defender,,48,1,West Bromwich Albion,Premier League (England),03/01/1988,,,,
Craig Cathcart,North-Ireland,"Another of Northern Ireland’s ex-Manchester United contingent, the defender has been used in a central back three by O’Neill but could operate at left back in France after Chris Brunt was ruled out by injury. Scored his first international goal in the final qualifier in Finland and added another in the friendly against Wales in March.",yes,,Defender,,27,2,Watford,Premier League (England),06/02/1989,,,,
Conor McLaughlin,North-Ireland,"The attack-minded right back established himself as first choice during the qualifying campaign. Belfast-born and brother of fellow international Ryan, he intends to repay Fleetwood Town for resurrecting his career following his release by Preston North End. “It will be brilliant to see Fleetwood represented at the European Championships,” he said.",yes,,Defender,,16,0,Fleetwood Town,League One (England),26/07/1991,,,,
Luke McCullough,North-Ireland,"The former Manchester United reserve impressed on an end-of-season tour of South America in 2014 against Uruguay and Chile. His ability to play central defence, right back or in central midfield could be beneficial in the tournament.",no,,Defender,,5,0,Doncaster Rovers,League One (England),15/02/1994,,,,
Shane Ferguson,North-Ireland,"Started the Euro qualifying campaign at left back but has also been used as a wing-back and winger depending on O’Neill’s tactics, although the former Gaelic footballer is yet to secure a regular place for club or country.",yes,,Defender,,24,1,Millwall,League One (England),12/07/1991,,,,
Lee Hodson,North-Ireland,"The Borehamwood-born defender with a Belfast-born grandmother made his international debut under Nigel Worthington and, though not a regular under O'Neill, his versatility across defence could be important.",yes,,Defender,,15,0,MK Dons,Championship (England),02/10/1991,,,,
Oliver Norwood,North-Ireland,The only player to start all 10 games of Northern Ireland’s record unbeaten run and played more minutes in the qualifying campaign than anyone else. Played for England at youth level but claims he was “tapped-up” by the Evans’ brothers during their time together at Manchester United.,no,,Midfielder,,32,0,Reading,Championship (England),12/04/1991,,,,
Aaron Hughes,North-Ireland,The longest serving member of the squad – having made his debut under Lawrie McMenemy in 1998 and captained his country 46 times – was talked out of international retirement by O’Neill in 2012. A century of caps has been frustrated by a run of unused substitute appearances but he has continued to travel from Australia without complaint and a taste of a first international tournament at the Euros would be a fitting reward for a distinguished servant.,yes,,Defender,,99,1,Melbourne City,A-League (Australia),08/11/1979,,,,
Steven Davis,North-Ireland,"Has seen it all with Northern Ireland, from defeat in Luxembourg during a World Cup qualifying campaign that produced one win in 10 games to the joy of securing a ticket to the Euros with two goals against Greece. The first captain to lead Northern Ireland to a European Championships was outstanding in qualifying. “One of the most under-rated players in the Premier League,” says O’Neill.",yes,Unsung hero,Midfielder,,82,8,Southampton,Premier League (England),01/01/1985,,,,
Chris Baird,North-Ireland,"A regular since making his debut shortly after appearing in the 2003 FA Cup final for Southampton, Baird’s versatility has been a crutch for several Northern Ireland managers and earned the Ballymoney player 76 caps. Valued for his defensive midfield work under O’Neill.",yes,,Defender,,77,0,Derby County,Championship (England),25/02/1982,,,,
Stuart Dallas,North-Ireland,"The Cookstown-born winger became a regular in O’Neill’s plans only last year but proved such an effective, reliable outlet – on either the left or right flank – that he appeared in all 10 games of Northern Ireland’s record unbeaten run.",yes,,Midfielder,,13,1,Leeds United,Championship (England),19/04/1991,,,,
Paddy McNair,North-Ireland,"Won his first cap against Scotland in March last year having come through the international ranks as a midfielder with Northern Ireland. Switched to defence by the coaches at Old Trafford, but O’Neill believes holding midfield is the youngster’s best position and deployed him there in Baird’s absence against Wales and Slovenia.",yes,,Midfielder,,8,0,Manchester United,Premier League (England),27/04/1995,,,,
Niall McGinn,North-Ireland,"Became the first Derry City player to win a Northern Ireland cap in 19 years when given his debut by Nigel Worthington in 2008. Influential throughout qualifying, he produced a vital goal in the win over Hungary and assists for three of Kyle Lafferty’s seven goals.",yes,,Midfielder,,41,2,Aberdeen,Premiership (Scotland),20/07/1987,,,,
Corry Evans,North-Ireland,"Made his international debut against Italy in 2009 without ever making a first team appearance for Manchester United. The versatility of the younger Evans’ brother has been important to several managers since, although an established role has been hard to come by.",yes,,Midfielder,,33,1,Blackburn Rovers,Championship (England),17/07/1990,,,,
Kyle Lafferty,North-Ireland,"Read the riot act by O’Neill after a reckless red card against Portugal in 2013 heightened fears that a promising career was going off the rails. No-one can fault the response. Lafferty scored seven goals in qualifying, remarkable for a player overlooked at club level, to become a national hero. “The team and the country needs the Kyle Lafferty with the head screwed on, not the clown,” he admitted.",yes,Maverick,Forward,,50,17,Norwich City,Premier League (England),16/09/1987,,,,
Jamie Ward,North-Ireland,"The Birmingham-born forward developed an effective right wing partnership with Conor McLaughlin during the qualifying campaign and has also impressed when deployed in attack by O’Neill, his work-rate and unselfishness helping others to shine.",yes,,Forward,,21,2,Nottingham Forest,Championship (England),12/05/1986,,,,
Conor Washington,North-Ireland,"A late addition to the squad with O’Neill requiring alternatives to Kyle Lafferty and seized his chance with a fine goal in the friendly defeat of Slovenia. Worked part-time as a postman while playing for non-league St Ives Town during the last European Championships. Qualified for Northern Ireland through his late Belfast-born grandmother, Pamela.",yes,Young talent,Forward,,3,2,Queens Park Rangers,Championship (England),18/05/1992,,,,
Josh Magennis,North-Ireland,"His transformation reflects that of the Northern Ireland team, though he has grown weary of re-telling the tale. Started as a goalkeeper at Cardiff City before, disillusioned, he switched to playing as a striker. Replaced the suspended Lafferty in the final home qualifier against Greece and duly scored his first international goal to ease the team’s passage to France. Otherwise used as an impact substitute.",yes,,Forward,,18,1,Kilmarnock,Premiership (Scotland),15/05/1990,,,,
Will Grigg,North-Ireland,Has made only seven senior appearances for Northern Ireland and did not feature at all during the qualifying campaign but is often an option for O'Neill from the bench.,yes,,Forward,,8,1,Wigan Athletic,League One (England),03/07/1991,,,,
